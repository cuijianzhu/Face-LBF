# How many landmarks for each face

# The index of left eye center in landmarks. If there is no landmark for eye center 
# in the landmark configuration, choose one near eye center (e.g. eye corner)

# Below are parameters of the model, you can refer to the paper I mentioned in 
# README.md to get a better understanding. If you don't quite understand, you
# can use the default value as below.

# The number of top-level stages
num_stages: 5

# The number of top-level stages
num_trees: 3

# The overlap ratio when deviding samples among trees
overlap_ratio: 0.3

# The number of random features generated for each top-level node
num_feats: 500

# The range of randomness for each feature. Must in range [0.01, 1]. Lower value 
# means features will be generated near the current guessed landmark positions.
# the number of radiuses should be eqaul to num_stages

# The Depth of trees

# Regularization coefficient
Beta: 1000

# The number of inintialization in testing. Lower value will speed up alignment,

TestInitShapeCount: 1

# Data argumentation factor. Lower value will speed up training, but may hurt
# accuracy
